# A study on the Android Platform

This project is a study on building native Android apps using Java. Most of the apps are simple apps, with the purpose of covering only a very specific topic. These are not finalised apps and serve no purpose other than the study of it.

The final app is a Weather app, with a launcher Widget. In it I tried to concentrate all the lessons learned into a final, complete project.
