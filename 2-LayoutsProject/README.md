# Layouts

In this project we create a new application that will allow us to understand the differences between the various layout types (LinearLayout, RelativeLayout and TableLayout), as well as introduce a new type of Activity called TabActivity. 

This TabActivity will consist of three tabs where each tab has a different layout type.
