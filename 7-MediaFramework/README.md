# Media Framework

This project creates an app that will use the camera of the device, capturing the image and showing it on the screen

It is also possible to take photos and save them to the memory card of the mobile device.

In addition to this functionality, a Custom View (a graphic object created by us) will be created, which will behave like a button. 
This component will have a background and will show a text that we want.

Finally, we will use Custom View on a layer above the camera image. 
We will create two instances of this View:
* one will play a song when we click on it, and only stops when we click it again; 
* the other will cause the device to vibrate whenever you press Custom View.
